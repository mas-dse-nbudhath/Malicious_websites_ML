# Malicious_websites_ML
## Project
The purpose of this project is to build a deep learning classifier in order to predict the malicious vs. benign URLs.
The traditional approach is to perform feature engineering, and generate features out of the URL. Common ones are using tokenization, TF-IDF of the URL itself (URL based features). We can also extend it further more, and create additional features: Lexical features, Host-based features, and/or content-based features. An alternate approach is to use deep learning algorithm, and let the model pick up the useful features itself.
